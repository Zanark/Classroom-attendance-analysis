# Classroom Attendance Analysis
A model which checks whether students are paying attention to the lecture or not.

## Abstract

Conventional  attendance  system  followed  in  an  educational system where the teacher call out the name of each and every student  and  mark  the  attendance  causes  time  wastage  during lecture  time.    This  becomes  more  and  more  severe especially in the current scenario where number of students in a class is very  large.    Managing  the  attendance  data  of  such  a  large group  is  also  very  difficult.  Another  disadvantage  of  present system is  the  chance  for  the  student  to  mark  fake  attendance. The application also records the mood of the student in the class which is believed to be an important thing to increase learning process effectiveness.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a branch of deep learning architectures and a part of Machine Learning, was used as a method in this application. The experiments were conducted through several stages such as face detection, image improvement and model formation.
