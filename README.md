# Classroom Attendance Analysis
A model which checks whether students are paying attention to the lecture or not.

## Abstract

The primary aim of this application is to be able to record the attendance of students inside a classroom without having to rollcall each student individually and updload the attendance data to the cloud so that a backup is maintained at all times and is easily accessible from any device with an internet connection and required permissions.
This application also aims to reduce the load of taking attendance manually inside a class and helps the teacher record the behaviour of the students to infer how effective the lecture is. The application provides the teacher with an insight into his own teaching patterns and habits which will the teacher to rectify any issues that may be a cause of the student's disinterest in the subject.


## Problem Statement

Conventional attendance system followed in an educational system where the teacher calls out the name of each and every student and marks the attendance causes time wastage during lecture time. This becomes more and more severe especially in the current scenario where number of students in a class is very large. Managing the attendance data of such a large group is also very difficult. Another disadvantage of present system is the chance for the student to mark fake attendance.
Morover the teacher is unable to determine exactly how many students do not have any interest in the lecture or how boring the lecture itself is.


## Proposed Work




Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a branch of deep learning architectures and a part of Machine Learning, was used as a method in this application. The experiments were conducted through several stages such as face detection, image improvement and model formation.
